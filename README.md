# VerilogHDL
Programming Verilog HDL on a DE1-SoC Development Kit using Quartus prime. This kit is built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA.

## Project 1
A parameterized 4-bit and 30-bit counter, multiplexer, and seven segment decoder were instantiated and binded to a a top level module to create a multi mode counter driven by switches and keys.

## Project 2
A game was constructed allowing two users to compete to see who has a faster reaction time. This was acheived by designing a clock divider, a counter, a hexadecimal to binary-coded decimal translater a seven-segment display handler, a random numbergenerator, and a top-level module interfacing the submodules, as well as other auxiliary modules.
