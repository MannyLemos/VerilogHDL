# VerilogHDL
Programming Verilog HDL on a DE1-SoC Development Kit using Quartus prime. This kit is built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA.

## Project 1
A parameterized 4-bit and 30-bit counter, multiplexer, and seven segment decoder where instantiated and binded to a a top level module to create a multi mode counter driven by switches and keys.
